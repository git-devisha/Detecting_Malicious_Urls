The Internet's growth has heightened focus on network security, crucial for its rapid development. Browser extensions, enhancing web applications, can also be malicious, accessing sensitive data unnoticed. They pose a significant threat due to their widespread use and extensive permissions. Detecting and mitigating these threats is challenging but essential. This paper reviews research on browser extension vulnerabilities, focusing on malicious links and various detection methods: intrusion detection, machine learning, and deep learning. Emphasizing proactive detection, it explores cybersecurity frameworks to counter both current and future threats effectively.

# Detecting Malicious URL Using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This project aims to detect malicious URLs using machine learning techniques. By analyzing features extracted from URLs, the model can classify whether a given URL is benign or malicious. This tool can help in enhancing web security and protecting users from phishing, malware, and other online threats.

## Features
- Extracts various features from URLs such as length, presence of special characters, and domain information.
- Implements machine learning models to classify URLs.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/git-devisha/code-rizzlers
   Detecting-Malicious-URL-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the URL detection tool, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Malicious_URL_pre.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the notebook cells in sequence:** The notebook contains all necessary steps for loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating the results.

## Data
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled URLs, classified as either benign or malicious. Ensure your data is in the correct format and placed in the appropriate directory.

- `data/urldata.csv`

The `urldata.csv` file should contain columns such as:
- `url`: The URL to be classified
- `label`: The label indicating whether the URL is benign or malicious

## Notebook Structure
The notebook `Malicious_URL_pre.ipynb` is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tqdm`, and `nltk`.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   from tqdm import tqdm
   import nltk
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
   ```

2. **Loading the Dataset:**
   - Load the URL dataset and display the first few entries.
   ```python
   df_data = pd.read_csv('data/urldata.csv')
   df_data.head()
   ```

3. **Preprocessing the Data:**
   - Filter and clean the dataset, retaining only relevant columns.
   ```python
   df_data = df_data.dropna()
   df_data['label'] = df_data['label'].map({'benign': 0, 'malicious': 1})
   ```

4. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract features from URLs, such as length and presence of special characters.
   ```python
   df_data['url_length'] = df_data['url'].apply(len)
   df_data['num_special_chars'] = df_data['url'].apply(lambda x: sum([1 for c in x if not c.isalnum()]))
   # Add other feature extraction steps here
   ```

5. **Model Training:**
   - Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data. Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
   ```python
   X = df_data[['url_length', 'num_special_chars']] # Add other features as necessary
   y = df_data['label']
   
   # Split the data
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   
   # Initialize models
   models = {
       'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000),
       'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
       'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)
   }
   
   # Train and evaluate models
   for model_name, model in models.items():
       print(f'Training {model_name}...')
       model.fit(X_train, y_train)
       y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
       accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
       precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
       recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
       f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
       print(f'{model_name} - Accuracy: {accuracy}, Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1 Score: {f1}')
   ```

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
   recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
   f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
   print(f'Precision: {precision}')
   print(f'Recall: {recall}')
   print(f'F1 Score: {f1}')
   ```
